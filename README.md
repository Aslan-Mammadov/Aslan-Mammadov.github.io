# KEBAB HOUSE -Asignment 1

* Aslan Mammadov.

* The main Page has navigation bar where you can navigate through the website.
* The website contains 2 html pages. Main page includes menu items and the reserve page includes form elements to collect user information stores them using forms.io
* The order link takes you to the Uber eats website where you can order online.
* On the bottom of the main page I included another link to take you back to the top of the main page.
* On this project I used HTML along with CSS to build and style the website. 
* I built the website first for mobile aplication then added media queries to change it's style for the wider screen sizes.
* For the future I want to add option where you can order using this website instead of going through uber eats.
